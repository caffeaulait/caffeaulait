<h2>Hi 👋, I'm Yang</h1>

I am currently working full-time as a software engineer, based in Shanghai, China.
<br />

For most time, I am writing backend projects using Go and Java. I also have some experience in frontend, though I am not good at styling :)
<br />

I don't write side projects as often now due to work commitments. However, I keep learning new technologies during spare time.
